date:   2017-05-10
excerpt: "The second face-to-face meeting for people, projects and organizations interested in participating in the openCypher project, with the goal of creating a standard language based on Cypher for querying graphs.."
---
This is the second face-to-face meeting for people, projects and organizations who are interested in

* implementing part or whole of the [Cypher graph query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/), including current implementers
* the design and development of a standard declarative query language for graph databases, and want to see how Cypher could evolve to reach that goal

oCIM is a conference organised by the [openCypher project](http://www.opencypher.org).

## Agenda

For the second oCIM, we want to encourage deeper involvement from parties outside Neo Technology by collaboratively creating an agenda via a conference call on Tuesday the **18th of April 2017**.
The call is scheduled for one hour and will start at **15.00 UTC**, which translates to:

* 19.00 IST (Tel Aviv)
* 17.00 CEST (Berlin)
* 16.00 BST (London)
* 11.00 EDT (New York)
* 8.00 PDT (San Francisco)

The call will open 15 minutes prior to the beginning of the meeting in order to allow some contingency in sorting out the technicalities of joining.

The agenda call will be hosted by Neo Technology using [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/).

### Discussion topics

To serve as an inspiration to the agenda-forming session, we have carefully selected a set of topics that are the most interesting from our point of view.
The list is not meant to serve as a partial agenda, but rather as input to the agenda meeting.

* Mode of collaboration
* Multiple graph querying
* Formal semantics of Cypher
* New language features
  * Regular Path Queries
  * Subqueries
  * Sorting Lists
  * Pattern Matching Semantics
  * Aggregation

The topic on aggregation has been raised by representatives of Scott Tiger.

## Logistics

The second oCIM will be held at **etc.venues Marble Arch** at Garfield House, 86 Edgware Road, W2 2EA in London, United Kingdom, on Wednesday the **10th of May 2017**.
