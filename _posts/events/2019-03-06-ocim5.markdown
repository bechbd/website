This is the fifth face-to-face meeting (with the option to dial in remotely) for people, projects and organizations who are interested in implementing part or whole of the [Cypher graph query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/), including current implementers.

oCIM is a conference organised by the [openCypher project](http://www.opencypher.org).

## Logistics

The fifth oCIM will be co-located with the [W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data (Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL)](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/index.html) and will be held [here](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html#location) in **Berlin, Germany** on **6 March 2019, starting at just after lunchtime, and ending in the early evening**.

We will also be providing a dial-in link in due course, allowing for **remote attendance**.

## Agenda 

We would welcome suggestions about topics of interest. 
For example, one of these could be the latest developments in compositional querying and managing multiple graphs. 

## Registration

Please email us at [info@opencypher.org](mailto:<info@opencypher.org>) if you have any questions or would like to suggest topics.
