excerpt: "This is the fifth face-to-face meeting (with the option to dial in remotely) for people, projects and organizations interested in participating in the openCypher project."

**Date: Wednesday PM, 6 March - Thursday AM, 7 March**

This is the fifth face-to-face meeting (with the option to dial in remotely) for people, projects and organizations who are interested in implementing part or whole of the [Cypher graph query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/), including current implementers.

oCIM is a conference organised by the [openCypher project](http://www.opencypher.org).

## Logistics

The fifth oCIM will be co-located with the [W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data (Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL)](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/index.html) and will be held [here](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html#location) in **Berlin, Germany** on **6 March 2019, starting at just after lunchtime, and ending just before lunchtime on 7 March 2019**.

## Agenda

### Wednesday 6 March PM

*Begin: 14:00* 

Welcome

#### openCypher and GQL

* Update on SQL/PGQ and GQL (_Keith Hare_, [_JCC Consulting_](http://www.jcc.com/) & _Jan Michels_ [_Oracle_](https://www.oracle.com/index.html))
* Existing Languages Working Group (_Thomas Frisendal_, [_Graph Data Modelling_](http://graphdatamodeling.com/))
* GQL and Cypher, along with graph querying and analytics ([_Neo4j_](https://neo4j.com/))

*BREAK*

#### Schema and multiple graphs

* Multiple graphs and composable queries, exemplified by a live demonstration of [CAPS](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-apache-spark) [Cypher for Apache Spark] ([_Neo4j_](https://neo4j.com/))
* Property Graph Schema ([_Neo4j_](https://neo4j.com/))
* An overview of [gra.fo](http://gra.fo/) (_Juan Sequeda_, [_Capsenta_](https://capsenta.com/))

*End: 18:00*

### Thursday 7 March AM

*Begin: 08:30*

Arrival and coffee

#### Path evaluation

* Variable Length Relationship Pattern Extensions (_Teon Banek & Marko Budiselić_, [_Memgraph_](https://memgraph.com/))
   * _Wouldn't it be nice if traversing a variable length relationship pattern could be more tunable? There are already some ideas about supporting the so called "regular patterns". They should behave similarly to how regular expressions behave. Unfortunately, regular patterns can be quite a burden to implement. Most users are happy with a simpler and smaller set of features for controlling the match pattern. This presentation shows how Memgraph extends variable length relationship patterns by giving users what they want while keeping the implementation simple. The extensions cover choosing the traversal strategy (depth-first, breadth-first, shortest path), as well as deciding on which paths to follow._
* Experimental Study of Context-Free Path Query Evaluation Methods (_Jochem Kuijpers_, [_Eindhoven University of Technology_](https://www.tue.nl/en/) / [_Neo4j_](https://neo4j.com/))
   * _Context-free path queries extend regular path queries for increased expressiveness. A context-free grammar is used to recognize accepted paths by their label strings, or traces. In this work, we study three context-free path query evaluation methods. We run query workloads on various data sets using these methods and compare their results. In particular, we showcase how these evaluation methods scale as graphs get bigger and queries become larger or more ambiguous._

#### Lightning talks

* Schema Validation and Evolution for Graph Databases (_Eugenia Oshurko_, [_University of Lyon_](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/))
* Named Property Graphs (_Łukasz Szeremeta_, [_University of Bialystok_](http://www.uwb.edu.pl/home))

#### Poster/Demo/Breakout session

   * TCK tools developed for Cypher for Gremlin
* Gremlinator (SPARQL to Gremlin) (_Harsh Thakkar_, [_The University of Bonn_](https://www.uni-bonn.de/the-university))

#### openCypher

* Overview of current CIPs (Cypher Improvement Proposals) ([_Neo4j_](https://neo4j.com/))
