excerpt: "We will present the major new features which will soon become part of Cypher."
---
At this meetup, we’re going to be giving high-level talks motivating the major new features that are going to be part of the Cypher language in the very near future.

Using examples, we will show why these features are useful, and how they can be used to solve complex problems.
We will end the evening with an illuminating talk on the interplay between research and industry within the area of graph processing.

This meetup is organised by the [openCypher project](http://www.opencypher.org).

## Provisional agenda

* Welcome and an introduction to openCypher. _(Petra Selmer, Neo4j)_
* Working on, processing, creating and and outputting multiple graphs. _(Stefan Plantikow, Neo4j)_
* Using subqueries for increased query expressivity, reuse and maintainability. _(TBD, Neo4j)_
* Supporting very complex patterns in Cypher. _(Tobias Lindaaker, Neo4j)_
* Academic research on graph processing: connecting recent findings to industrial technologies _(Gábor Szárnyas, Budapest University of Technology and Economics)_
   * Graph theory is part of every computer science curriculum.
   However, there is surprisingly little interaction between academic and industrial graph research communities.
   To reveal topics for potential collaboration, key research directions in academia will be highlighted, and their possible applications will be shown.
