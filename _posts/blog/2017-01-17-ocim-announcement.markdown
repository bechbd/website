### We are very pleased to announce the First openCypher Implementers Meeting (oCIM)

This is the first face-to-face meeting for people, projects and companies who are interested in

* implementing part or whole of the [Cypher language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/), including current implementers (there are now approaching ten [projects](http://opencypher.org/projects) or products, commercial and research)
* the design of a standard declarative query language for graph databases, and want to see how Cypher could evolve to help that goal

### Topics

We will be releasing the full programme in the next few days, which will comprise talks in areas such as:

* Demonstrations and talks by implementers
* Cypher conformance testing with the Technology Compatibility Kit
* Round table discussions on how to approach possible new major features in areas such as
  * Named graphs, multiple graphs and views
  * Improved schema and constraints
  * Stronger typing
  * Conjunctive regular path queries (CRPQs)
* Cypher gaps, annoyances and improvements
* How to broaden involvement in the Cypher Improvement Proposal process, and how to progress towards a formal standard, e.g. work on semantic specification.

Please view further details and the conference programme at the [events page](http://opencypher.org/event/2017/02/08/event-ocim1/).

### Date and location

The meeting will be kindly hosted by SAP, in their HQ in **Walldorf, Germany**, on Wednesday the **8th of February 2017**.
