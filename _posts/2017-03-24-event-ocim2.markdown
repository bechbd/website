date:   2017-05-10
excerpt: "The second face-to-face meeting for people, projects and organizations interested in participating in the openCypher project, with the goal of creating a standard language based on Cypher for querying graphs.."
---
This is the second face-to-face meeting for people, projects and organizations who are interested in

* implementing part or whole of the [Cypher graph query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/), including current implementers
* the design and development of a standard declarative query language for graph databases, and want to see how Cypher could evolve to reach that goal

oCIM is a conference organised by the [openCypher project](http://www.opencypher.org).

## Agenda

For the second oCIM, we want to encourage deeper involvement from parties outside Neo Technology by collaboratively creating an agenda via a conference call on Thursday the **6th of April 2017**.
The agenda call will be hosted by Neo Technology using [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/).
To participate in the agenda-forming session, either join using the desktop client, or through a web browser, or through a smartphone app, or dial in using a phone.
The call is scheduled for one hour and will start at **15.00 UTC**, which translates to:

* 19.00 IST (Tel Aviv)
* 17.00 CEST (Berlin)
* 16.00 BST (London)
* 11.00 EDT (New York)
* 8.00 PDT (San Francisco)

The call will open 15 minutes prior to the beginning of the meeting in order to allow some contingency in sorting out the technicalities of joining.

### Discussion topics

To serve as an inspiration to the agenda-forming session, we have carefully selected a set of topics that are the most interesting from our point of view.
The list is not meant to serve as a partial agenda, but rather as input to the agenda meeting.

* Mode of collaboration
* Multiple graph querying
* Formal semantics of Cypher
* New language features
  * Regular Path Queries
  * Subqueries
  * Sorting Lists
  * Pattern Matching Semantics
  * Aggregation

The topic on aggregation has been raised by representatives of Scott Tiger.

## Logistics

The second oCIM will be held at **etc.venues Marble Arch** at Garfield House, 86 Edgware Road, W2 2EA in London, United Kingdom, on Wednesday the **10th of May 2017**.
