This is the sixth virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

This meeting is dedicated the topic of subqueries and to the planning of oCIM 3, which is to take place in France, November 2017.
In addition, a way forward will be discussed regarding the establishment of common conventions for the structure of the namespace of a (vendor-specific) function or procedure.
