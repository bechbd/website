    ## Proposed Agenda

    * Multiple graphs, syntax and semantics
        * **[CIR-2017-182](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues/182)**: Adding support for multiple graphs _(Stefan Plantikow)_
---
This is the fifth virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

This meeting is intended as a catch-all of topics that time did not allow prior oCIG meetings to reach conclusion on, especially topics related to multiple graphs.
The list of referenced CIRs and CIPs on the agenda will be updated as relevant entries come up.
