    ## Proposed Agenda

    * How openCypher relates to graph query language discussions in ISO and LDBC _(Alastair Green)_
    * Controllable morphism: walks, trails, and paths
        * **[CIR-2017-174](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues/174)**: Isomorphic pattern matching and configurable uniqueness _(Stefan Plantikow)_
        * **[CIP-2017-01-18](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/pull/175)**: Configurable Pattern Matching Semantics _(Stefan Plantikow)_
    * SQL and Cypher (and PGQL) _(Peter Furniss & Alastair Green)_
    * Graph addressing in support of multiple graphs _(Peter Furniss & Alastair Green)_

This is the third virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

The proposed agenda focuses on adding support for control over pattern matching 'morphism', and graph addressing.

Additionally, there are interesting discussions in ISO and the LDBC Query Language Task Force around graph querying, which are relevant for the openCypher community.
An important aspect of these discussions is the relationship between SQL and a native property graph query language like Cypher.
