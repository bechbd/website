            <h3>What is Cypher?</h3>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Cypher is a graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying of graph data.
                    Cypher is intuitive, powerful and easy to learn.</p>
                <p>It lets you write graph queries by describing patterns in your data. Because graphs already describe
                    your domain, Cypher lets you focus on your domain instead of getting lost in the mechanics of data
                    access. </p>
                <p>Designed to be a human readable query language, Cypher is suitable for developers and operations
                    professionals alike. The guiding principle behind Cypher is to make simple things easy and complex
                    things possible. Cypher combines English prose and intuitive iconography, making queries more
                    self-explanatory.</p>
                <p>Cypher is declarative, which means it lets users express what data to retrieve, letting the engine
                    underneath take care of seamlessly retrieving it. In contrast, imperative or scripting languages,
                    including early-generation graph languages, require query writers to have a deep technical
                    understanding of physical implementation details. Cypher eliminates this burden.</p>

                <p>The expressive querying of Cypher is inspired by a number of different approaches and established
                    practices. Most of the keywords, such as <code>WHERE</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code> , are inspired
                    by SQL, while pattern matching borrows from SPARQL. In addition, some of the collection semantics
                    have been borrowed from languages such as Haskell and Python.</p>

            <h3>How does openCypher benefit me?</h3>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>The openCypher project makes it possible for any developer or technology provider to use Cypher and
                    incorporate graph processing capabilities within that product or application.</p>

                <p>Easy-to-learn and yet extremely powerful, Cypher is the industry’s most successful and widely adopted
                    graph query language. With the advent of openCypher, the language promises to be just as
                    instrumental in the growth of graph processing and analysis as SQL was instrumental in accelerating
                    the adoption of RDBMS. </p>

                <p>With tens of thousands of users already trained in Cypher and numerous tooling providers already
                    offering support for the language, openCypher provides a seamless way for industry participants to
                    provide graph capabilities in their data platforms – ranging from database suppliers, tooling
                    vendors and the broader graph ecosystem.</p>

                <h5>For data and tooling providers:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve time to market with tools, tests and specifications that enable rapid access to graph
                        processing capabilities
                    </li>
                    <li>Collaborate on the evolution of Cypher to increase the size of the graph ecosystem</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>For application developers:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reuse graph query knowledge and skills across a multitude of products that support</li>
                    <li>Cypher as the graph query language</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>For enterprises:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interoperability and vendor independence by interfacing with products using a common query
                        language
                    </li>
                    <li>Higher availability of skilled developers trained in a graph query language used across multiple
                        products
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h3>What will be delivered as part of openCypher?</h3>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>The project aims to deliver four types of artifacts: </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cypher Reference Documentation</strong><br/>
                    Comprehensive user documentation describing use of the Cypher query language with examples and
                    tutorials.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Grammar specification</strong><br/>
                    A syntax and language composition specification in XML format, along with derived artifacts
                    comprising a parser, EBNF-style grammar(s), and railroad diagrams.
                <li><strong>TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit)</strong><br/>
                    The TCK consists of a number of tests that a software supplier would run in order to self-certify
                    support for a given version of Cypher.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cypher language specification</strong><br/>
                    Licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative
                        Commons license</a>, the Cypher language specification is a technical expression of the language
                    syntax to enable parsers to auto-generate the query syntax. A full semantic specification is also
                    planned as a part the openCypher project.
                </li>

        <h3>What is the industry saying about openCypher?</h3>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <h4>SAP</h4>
            <p><em>"Cypher Query Language is the de-facto open industry standard for graph processing. SAP HANA Graph now
                supports a subset of Cypher (focusing on the querying aspects) – making it possible to migrate existing
                apps to HANA more easily or simply take advantage of existing skills. So if MATCH, WHERE and RETURN
                clauses are your thing you're well set! Cypher scripts can be embedded during pattern patching via the
                graph node of the calculation view editor in SAP Web IDE for HANA or from SQLScript."</em><br/>
                - Philip Mugglestone, SAP HANA
            </p>

            <h4>Databricks</h4>
            <p><em>"Graph processing is becoming an indispensable part of the modern big data stack. Neo4j’s Cypher
                query language has greatly accelerated graph database adoption. We look forward to bringing Cypher’s
                graph pattern matching capabilities into the Spark stack, making graph querying more accessible to the
                masses."</em><br/>
                - Ion Stoica, CEO, DataBricks</p>

            <h4>Neo4j</h4>
            <p><em>"Companies such as Google, Facebook and LinkedIn have leveraged graph processing to transform their
                respective industries. openCypher promises to bring the same transformative power of graphs to
                enterprises of any size."</em><br/>
                - Emil Eifrem, CEO of Neo4j, Creator of Neo4j and Cypher</p>
